- View personal timetable
- Manage own calendar events

### Student
- Signup/login after admin approval
- View department-based personal timetable
- View institute timetable with filters
- View academic calendar and event details

## Mathematical Timetable Generation (Brief)
The timetable is generated using Binary Integer Linear Programming:
- Decision variable: `x[c,s,r]` (course-slot-room assignment, 0/1)
- Hard constraints:
  - Required classes per course
  - Teacher clash prevention
  - Room clash prevention
  - Room capacity constraints
- Objective:
  - Minimize preference violations
  - Minimize late-slot usage
  - Apply teacher-priority cost

Implementation file: `timetable.py`

## How to Start the Project

### 1. Open terminal in project folder
```bash
cd /d c:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\MiniProject2\Code\SmartTimetable
```

### 2. Install dependencies (first time only)
```bash
pip install flask pulp
```

### 3. Run the server
```bash
python app.py
```

### 4. Open browser
```text
http://127.0.0.1:5000/login
```

If port `5000` is busy:
```bash
set PORT=5050
python app.py
```
Then open:
```text
http://127.0.0.1:5050/login
```

## Recommended Demo Flow
1. Login as admin
2. Approve pending teacher/student accounts
3. Approve teacher preference requests
4. Open `Generate Timetable` section
5. Review `Generation Stack`
6. Generate timetable
7. Verify timetable in admin, teacher, and student dashboards

## Notes
- This project uses file-based persistence for academic/demo simplicity.
- Deleting/editing rows in generate snapshot also syncs source preferences for future generation consistency.
