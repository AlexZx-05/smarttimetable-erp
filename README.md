# Smart Timetable Optimization System

This project is a web-based academic timetable generation system using
Integer Linear Programming (ILP).

## Features
- Admin, Teacher, and Student roles
- Teacher preference-based scheduling
- Soft constraints with weighted penalties
- Automatic timetable generation using ILP (PuLP)
- Student dashboard to view final timetable
- Admin approval workflow for teachers

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- PuLP (ILP Solver)
- HTML, CSS
- File-based storage (for academic demo)

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install flask pulp

2. Run the application:
   python app.py

3. Open browser:
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/login

## Academic Purpose
This project demonstrates how mathematical optimization
(Integer Linear Programming) can be applied to real-world
academic scheduling problems.
